### Biography

As an incoming Master's candidate in Cyberspace Security at NUDT, my academic inquiry is centered on the symbiotic relationship between system construction and fortification. My expertise spans both Full-Stack Development and defensive security principles, operating on the thesis that one cannot truly secure a system without mastering the art of its creation. I employ Python for rapid prototyping and security automation, while leveraging Rust for building performant, memory-safe applications from the ground up. I'm currently initializing my research parameters, eager to apply this dual perspective to solve complex, real-world engineering challenges.
